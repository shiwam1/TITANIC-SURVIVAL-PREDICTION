# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION
I had predicted the survival of persons on the titanic accident. Here I got 81% accuracy of the model by using LOGISTIC REGRESSION and also interpreting
>ROC CURVE, ACCURACY CHECKING FOR DIFFERENT THRESHOLD 
VALUES, and also CONFUSION MATRIX.
On this project I had taken the dataset from KAGGLE which contain
Training dataset=891 rows × 12 columns
Test dataset= 418 rows × 12 columnS.
